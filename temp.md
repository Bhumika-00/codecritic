❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){return a+b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
*   ❌ The function `sum` attempts to add `a` and `b` without them being defined within the function scope. This will likely lead to errors because `a` and `b` are not accessible within the function unless they are global variables or passed as arguments.
*   ❌ The function does not accept any arguments, making it inflexible and only able to work if `a` and `b` are defined in the global scope (which is generally bad practice).
*   ❌ No return type declaration, making the code ambiguous.

✅ Recommended Fix:
```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:
*   ✔️ The function now accepts `a` and `b` as arguments, making it more reusable and predictable.
*   ✔️ The function now explicitly returns the sum of `a` and `b`.
*   ✔️ By accepting arguments, the function avoids relying on global variables, improving code quality and reducing potential side effects.

Final Note:
Always define variables within the scope where they are used or pass them as arguments to functions to avoid unexpected behavior and improve code maintainability.
